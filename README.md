# Social Media Friends Distance GUI
Winner of Choose Ohio First CS Best Project Presentation!

A GUI-based application written in Python that visualizes data from a California based database of Facebook user's friends and their physical distances from one another within the state. Can be run by cloning this repository into an IDE with a Python interpreter and the following packages downloaded: numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn.

(There are currently 4 social network dataset files that could not be hosted on GitHub due to their enormous size. May be able to host later with GitHub Large File Storage.)
